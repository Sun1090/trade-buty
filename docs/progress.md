# Progress

## 2026-09-11 — R12.25 Retention metric definitions & audit doc — R12 complete

Closed R12 with `docs/retention-metrics.md`, an honest retention-metrics constitution:

- §0 records the binding constraint: no server-side cohort analytics exists by design (privacy constitution), so every metric is defined as locally computable or computable from the user's own export.
- §1 defines the metrics with exact data sources: active learning day (≥60s in the study-time ledger), 7-day active days/minutes, weekly goal attainment, streak semantics (truthful `tb-streak` increment/break behavior, longest as monotonic max counter), revisit proxy, due-review visibility, and the R12.23 cross-surface consistency invariant — plus explicit "NOT retention metrics" exclusions.
- §2 audits trim policies (90-day study ledger, 100-round replay history) and bans labeling trimmed numbers as "all-time" — matching the R12.14 privacy-page wording.
- §3 ties to the R12.24 no-login parity contract; §4 leaves an audit checklist including a gate that any future server-side retention telemetry must be reviewed here first.

Verification recorded:

- Doc claims were checked against code (`streak.ts`, `study-time.ts`, `replay-store.ts`, `wrongbook.ts`); the longest-streak wording was corrected to match the monotonic `tb-streak.longest` counter.
- Roadmap: all 25 R12 items are now complete.

Next queue:

1. Watch PR #1 CI after this push; consider squashing/merging once the whole milestone is verified on production CI.
2. Next milestone suite per roadmap: R13 feedback loop / P2 quality (chapter-level quizzes expansion, share quality, etc.) or the governance backlog.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.13 Privacy entry review + R12.14 Data retention notes

## 2026-09-11 — R12.13 Privacy entry review + R12.14 Data retention notes

R12.13 review found a real gap: the privacy page (`/privacy`, R9.x) was an orphan — no link existed anywhere in the app chrome:

- Added a "隐私政策 / Privacy Policy" link to the global footer navigation (always-visible entry, next to Stats), with `footer.privacy` i18n keys for both locales.
- Verified page completeness: localStorage statement, Supabase sync statement, cookie scope, third-party list, and the R9.9 `PrivacyDataExport` block are all present.

R12.14 (data retention & cleanup notes) is now documented truthfully in the privacy page itself, sourced from actual code behavior:

- Local data expires only when the user clears site data; built-in trims: study-time ledger keeps the last 90 days (`study-time.ts`), replay history keeps the latest 100 rounds (`replay-store.ts` / `sync-layer.ts`).
- Cloud data persists while the account exists; offline write queue retries until synced; deletion path documented (account menu → Delete account removes cloud rows + local data, backed by `account-delete.ts` + `auth-header`).
- No misleading retention promises were added (no invented "we delete after N days" claims).

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suites: `src/lib/i18n.test.ts`, `src/lib/i18n-stats.test.ts`, `src/components/privacy-data-export.test.tsx` passed (18 tests).
- Typecheck gate: `npm run typecheck` passed; lint gate passed; `npm run check:ai-copy` passed (en dict has no zh leftovers).

Next queue:

1. Watch PR #1 CI after this push.
2. Finish R12.25 retention metric definitions & audit docs — then R12 is fully closed; move to the R13 share/mobile/growth-quality suite or the P2 governance backlog per roadmap.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.15–R12.17 Local review reminders

## 2026-09-11 — R12.15–R12.17 Local review reminders

Implemented the reminder triad as one coherent in-site system (no push, no service worker, no permissions — consistent with the no-tracking constitution):

- Added `src/lib/review-reminder.ts`: settings (cadence off/daily/weekly + DND start/end hour) with repair-on-read clamping; `inDndWindow` supporting cross-midnight windows (22→8) and start==end as disabled; `reminderPeriodKey` (local date / ISO week via Thursday rule) so each period shows at most one banner; `shouldShowReminder` is pure with an injectable `now` — unit tests never touch real time.
- Stats dashboard: dismissible reminder banner appears only with due reviews, outside the DND window, once per period (CTA links to `/{locale}/review`; "Later" marks the period shown). A settings section edits cadence and DND window with bilingual labels and persists immediately.
- Snapshot-stability lesson applied: `useSyncExternalStore` snapshots are raw strings and the parsed settings object is memoized — object-valued snapshots cause infinite re-render loops.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suites: `src/lib/review-reminder.test.ts` (9 tests incl. cross-midnight, ISO-week boundaries, dedup), `src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` (3 reminder UI specs) passed.
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 140 test files and 1062 tests.
- Lint gate: `npm run lint -- --quiet` passed; typecheck gate passed; `npm run check:ai-copy` passed.
- Prior push CI on PR #1 passed (ci + Vercel).

Next queue:

1. Watch PR #1 CI after this push.
2. Remaining R12: R12.13 privacy settings entry review, R12.14 retention docs, R12.25 retention metric audit docs — then R14 governance backlog (R14.1–R14.10).

## 2026-09-11 — R12.18 Completion celebration audit (no profit hints)

## 2026-09-11 — R12.18 Completion celebration audit (no profit hints)

Audited `ChapterCompleteCelebration` and found a real constitution violation, now fixed:

- The emoji sequence contained 📈 (bull-market gains) and 💎 ("diamond hands" holding meme), which violate the "never imply returns" rule. The list is now exported as `CELEBRATION_EMOJIS` and restricted to learning-neutral glyphs (🎉 📖 ✨ ✅ 📚 🎓); a regression test asserts the forbidden set ({📈💎🚀💰🤑🐂🌕}) stays excluded.
- Copy was hardcoded zh "篇章完成！" — now localized via `locale` prop (zh/en) and wired from the knowledge chapter page; the overlay gained `role="status"` for screen readers.
- Tests lock: celebration appears only for genuinely complete chapters, copy never mentions profit/win-rate/returns, and the overlay auto-dismisses.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/components/chapter-complete-celebration.test.tsx` passed (3 tests).
- Typecheck gate: `npm run typecheck` passed.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.24 Guest-mode stats degradation contract

## 2026-09-11 — R12.24 Guest-mode stats degradation contract

Implemented R12.24 as a verified no-login parity contract (the stats page was already local-first; this locks it with regression coverage):

- Added `src/components/stats-client-guest.test.tsx`: three specs proving that with no AuthProvider and no Supabase env, the dashboard renders every section (overview, all four trends, weekly report + summary, next suggestion), the source badge reads "本机数据", range switching persists, a guest export produces the complete versioned payload (correct counts from seeded local ledgers), and no login wall / degraded placeholder text ever appears.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/components/stats-client-guest.test.tsx` passed (3 tests).

## 2026-09-11 — R12.19 Editable weekly learning goal + R12.20 Local weekly summary

## 2026-09-11 — R12.19 Editable weekly learning goal + R12.20 Local weekly summary

Implemented R12.19 and R12.20 as one coherent goal-and-feedback pair (daily goal was already tier-editable with cloud double-write; the real gap was the weekly axis):

- Added `src/lib/weekly-summary.ts`: `WEEKLY_GOAL_TIERS` (45/90/150 min, default 90) with `getWeeklyGoalMin`/`setWeeklyGoalMin` (persists `tb-weekly-goal-min`, dispatches `tb-weekly-goal`, fire-and-forget cloud upsert), and pure `buildWeeklySummary()` over the study-time ledger + progress/quiz/review ledgers + replay history — last-7-calendar-day window compared by local date strings, corruption-tolerant, no fabricated dates.
- Cloud sync: migration `supabase/migrations/0007_weekly_goal_min.sql` adds `user_settings.weekly_goal_min`; hydrate merges local-intent-first like the daily goal; `syncWeeklyGoalUpsert` + queue executor `goal` kind now upserts whichever goal field is present; R12.9 conflict detection extended with the `weekly-goal` kind.
- Stats dashboard gains a "本周学习摘要 / Weekly learning summary" card showing the generated line (minutes, active days, completions, quizzes, reviews, replay rounds) plus achieved/remaining state and the editable goal tier row.
- Tests: pure builder (window boundaries with endpoint-inclusive semantics, corruption, achieved-only-on-real-minutes), storage tier clamping, cloud merge + conflict wiring, and three UI specs (summary render, tier edit persistence, honest achieved state).

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suites: `src/lib/weekly-summary.test.ts`, `src/lib/sync-conflicts.test.ts`, `src/lib/sync-layer-hydrate.test.ts`, `src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` all passed.
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 137 test files and 1044 tests.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.12 Versioned stats data export

## 2026-09-11 — R12.12 Versioned stats data export

Implemented R12.12 as a local, versioned JSON export on the stats dashboard:

- Added `src/lib/stats-export.ts`: `buildStatsExport()` (pure, injectable clock) emits `{ format: "trade-buty-stats-export", version: 1, exportedAt, locale, data }` with stable field names for courses/quizzes/replay/review/engagement/goals; all numeric inputs clamped so corrupt local state never produces NaN/negative garbage; `serializeStatsExport()` + `downloadStatsExport()` (blob + temp anchor, dated filename).
- Export button on the stats overview grid builds the payload from the live models — zero network calls (privacy-constitution compliant), labels bilingual.
- Tests: field-shape/version assertions, corrupt-input sanitization, null-percentage and locale coercion, JSON round-trip, and the download helper wiring.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/stats-export.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed (24 tests).
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 137 test files and 1034 tests.
- Lint gate: `npm run lint -- --quiet` passed; typecheck gate passed; `npm run check:ai-copy` passed.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.11 Per-section empty-state CTAs on stats

## 2026-09-11 — R12.11 Per-section empty-state CTAs on stats

Implemented R12.11 as actionable empty states inside each stats trend section (the page-level new-user CTA from R4.5 only covers the all-zero case):

- Quiz trend: when no quiz was ever finished, links to the first chapter quiz (`/{locale}/knowledge/{firstChapter}`).
- Review efficiency: when the mistake log is empty and no review has ever been recorded, explains that quiz attempts feed the wrongbook and links to the first chapter quiz.
- Replay practice time: when no replay was ever done, links to `/{locale}/replay`.
- CTAs disappear as soon as real data exists (tests assert the toggle on finished quizzes / wrongbook entries).
- zh/en labels added (`ctaQuiz`/`ctaReview`/`ctaReplay`).

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed (19 tests).
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 136 test files and 1025 tests.
- Lint gate: `npm run lint -- --quiet` passed; typecheck gate passed; `npm run check:ai-copy` passed.
- PR #1 CI (vitest + mutation + deps + bundle + mobile) passed on `d9ace57`.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.9 Multi-device sync conflict notice

## 2026-09-11 — R12.9 Multi-device sync conflict notice

Implemented R12.9 as a truthful, auto-resolving conflict surface for multi-device sync:

- Added `src/lib/sync-conflicts.ts`: pure `detectMergeConflicts()` (daily-goal divergence when both sides explicitly set values, same-key wrongbook SRS/picked divergence with resolution direction), plus `tb-sync-conflicts` record/dismiss storage with per-timestamp dismissal so a genuinely new conflict set re-notifies.
- `hydrateFromCloud()` now computes conflicts from the pre-merge local snapshot vs. cloud rows and records them after every merge (empty conflicts clear prior records); failure paths never leave stale notices.
- The stats dashboard shows a dismissible "多设备同步提示 / Multi-device sync note" banner describing the automatic merge rules (local goal wins, newer review plan wins) instead of silently overwriting.
- Tests cover detection edge cases (one-side-unset is not a conflict, cloud-only keys ignored, resolution direction), storage/dismissal semantics, the hydrate wiring, and banner render/dismiss behavior.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/sync-conflicts.test.ts src/lib/sync-layer-hydrate.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed.
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 136 test files and 1025 tests.
- Lint gate: `npm run lint -- --quiet` passed; typecheck gate passed.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.23 Stats consistency audit

## 2026-09-11 — R12.23 Stats consistency audit

Implemented R12.23 as a cross-aggregator reconciliation auditor plus dev-time diagnosis:

- Added `src/lib/stats-consistency.ts`: `auditStatsConsistency()` asserts the identities and range invariants that must hold when every stats widget reads the same local facts — course overview ↔ course trend (readDocs/doneChapters/totalDocs/completionPct), quiz done counts, replay rounds, wrong pending vs due/overdue ranges, and all percentage fields inside [0,100] or null.
- `StatsClient` runs the audit in non-production builds and `console.warn`s on drift (tree-shaken out of production bundles).
- Tests prove the real builders agree on a shared fixture (zero issues) and that the auditor catches course/quiz/replay/wrong drift, range inversions, out-of-range percentages, and missing inputs.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/stats-consistency.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed.
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 134 test files and 1015 tests.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.8 Local/cloud data source labels

## 2026-09-11 — R12.8 Local/cloud data source labels

Implemented R12.8 as a truthful data-source indicator on the stats dashboard:

- Added `src/lib/cloud-sync-meta.ts`: `recordCloudSync()` / `getLastCloudSync()` for the last successful cloud-merge timestamp (`tb-last-cloud-sync`), corrupt-value safe.
- `hydrateFromCloud()` now records the timestamp after a successful merge (failed hydrations never fake a sync).
- The stats overview source pill is now dynamic: signed-out visitors see "本机数据 / This device"; signed-in users see "本机 + 云端 / Local + cloud" plus the last cloud-sync time (localized).
- Added zh/en labels and tests for the meta store, the hydrate wiring, and the signed-out rendering path.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/cloud-sync-meta.test.ts src/lib/sync-layer-hydrate.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.10 Time-range filter + R12.21 stats mobile layout gate

## 2026-09-11 — R12.10 Time-range filter + R12.21 stats mobile layout gate

Implemented R12.10 as a shared, persisted time-range filter for the four R12 trend sections, and turned R12.21 into an automated 320px gate for the stats page:

- Added `src/lib/stats-range.ts`: 7/30-day tiers with sanitizing read (invalid/missing → 7, read-only fallback), persisted `tb-stats-range-days`, and `tb-stats-range` broadcast event.
- `StatsClient` subscribes via `useSyncExternalStore` and re-aggregates all four trends (course completion, quiz score, review efficiency, replay time) at the selected range; charts switch to equal-width columns (`gridTemplateColumns` inline style, no Tailwind purge risk) and 30-day views get horizontal scroll containers so the 320px layout never overflows.
- Range toggle is keyboard/screen-reader accessible (`role="group"` + `aria-pressed`) and the course trend chart's accessible name now reflects the active range.
- R12.21: added `/zh/stats` and `/en/stats` to `check:mobile` (CI-gated 320px overflow regression) so every new stats component stays inside the mobile budget permanently.
- Added zh/en labels and tests for tier sanitization, persistence, event broadcast, toggle rendering, persisted 30-day re-aggregation, and grid column switching.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/stats-range.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.7 Personalized next learning suggestion

Implemented R12.7 as a deterministic, local-data-driven "Up next" suggestion (review dues > next unread > chapter quiz > replay warm-up):

- Added `src/lib/next-suggestion.ts`: `buildNextSuggestion()` pure decision function with localized hrefs, context titles, and honest reasons (`due-reviews` / `next-unread` / `chapter-quiz` / `replay-warmup` / `all-clear`).
- Stats page now serves chapter titles and doc metadata into `StatsClient`; the suggestion renders as a highlighted card directly under the learning overview section, recomputed from live local data on every progress event.
- Distinct from `/path`'s `TodayPick`: that one only considers reading progress, while R12.7 weighs SRS dues, quizzes, and replay practice.
- Added zh/en labels and fixture coverage for priority order, replay warm-up threshold (<3 rounds), corrupt inputs, slug fallbacks, and stats-page rendering of all three main branches.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/next-suggestion.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed with 2 files and 17 tests.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.6 Gentle streak recovery prompt

Implemented R12.6 as a fact-only, action-oriented recovery card (distinct from R4.3's fact reassurance inside DailyGoal):

- Added `src/lib/streak-recovery.ts`: `buildStreakRecovery()` pure decision function — shows only when the streak actually broke AND today has zero study minutes (hides automatically once the user restarts, so no nagging).
- Action priority derived from real local data: due SRS reviews first, then continue an unfinished chapter, else a replay warm-up; capped at two actions with localized hrefs.
- Added `src/components/streak-recovery-card.tsx` on `/[locale]/stats` with useSyncExternalStore subscriptions (auto-hides when today goes above zero), a per-day "later" dismiss (`tb-recovery-dismissed`), and accessible section labeling.
- Added zh/en stats labels for the recovery card.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.5 Replay practice time trend

Implemented R12.5 as local-data-first replay practice duration statistics with no fabricated durations:

- Extended `ReplayRecord` with optional `durationSec`; `replay-trainer` now records the measured round elapsed seconds (only when a round-start timestamp exists, capped at 8h).
- Added `src/lib/replay-time-trend.ts` as a versioned pure aggregator over local replay history: per-day rounds/duration/accuracy buckets, in-range summary, all-time totals, and best streak (merged with `tb-replay-best` at render time).
- Kept legacy semantics honest: rounds always count from real `at` timestamps, but old records without `durationSec` report `hasDurations: false` + warning `no-round-durations` and zero duration — never estimated.
- Integrated an accessible replay time section into `/[locale]/stats`: daily bars (duration labels), rounds in range, time in range, average per round, best streak, and a legacy no-duration notice.
- Added zh/en stats labels for the replay time section.
- Added tests for day bucketing, accuracy clamping, duration sanitization (negative/NaN/8h cap), legacy no-duration warnings, empty history, corrupt entries, range clamping, and stats-page rendering.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/replay-time-trend.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed with 2 files and 15 tests.

- Sandbox note: fonts.googleapis.com is unreachable from this dev sandbox, so the local build was verified with Geist temporarily self-hosted via `next/font/local`; committed code keeps the unchanged `next/font/google` layout and CI remains the authoritative build gate.

## 2026-09-11 — R12.4 Wrongbook review efficiency (+R12.22 stats page bundle budget)

Implemented R12.4 as local-data-first wrongbook review efficiency statistics with no fabricated review dates, and landed the R12.22 stats-page performance budget work needed to ship it:

- Added `src/lib/review-attempt-ledger.ts`: `tb-review-attempts` local ledger (capped at 300 entries), written by `applySrsResult()` for every SRS answer — both correct/mastered and reset outcomes — with idempotent same-timestamp writes.
- Added `src/lib/wrongbook-efficiency.ts` as a versioned pure aggregator over the current wrongbook (authoritative pending state) and the review ledger: per-day reviews/correct/mastered buckets with accuracy, due-today/overdue backlog from SRS fields (backfill semantics consistent with `effectiveSrs`), average stage progress, and mastered totals.
- Kept legacy semantics honest: without a ledger the section reports `dataSource: "current-wrongbook-only"`, `hasLedger: false`, warning `no-review-dates`, and still shows live due/pending counts — no invented dates.
- Integrated an accessible review efficiency section into `/[locale]/stats` with a stacked correct/total mini chart and summary cards (reviews, accuracy, mastered, due now).
- R12.22: extracted the entire stats dictionary from `src/lib/i18n.ts` into `src/lib/i18n-stats.ts` (imported only by the stats page) so stats copy no longer inflates every route's shared chunk; added a dedicated `zh/stats` budget (320KB, measured 306KB) to `check-bundle.mjs`; extended `check-ai-copy.mjs` to scan both dictionary files.
- Added zh/en labels and deep-parity + no-CJK tests for the split stats dictionary.
- Added tests for trend bucketing, due/overdue/backfill semantics, corrupt/unknown entries, range clamping, ledger idempotency/capping, SRS ledger wiring, and stats-page rendering.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/wrongbook-efficiency.test.ts src/lib/review-attempt-ledger.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx src/lib/i18n-stats.test.ts src/lib/i18n.test.ts src/lib/wrongbook.test.ts` passed.
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 128 test files and 980 tests.
- Lint gate: `npm run lint -- --quiet` passed.
- Typecheck gate: `npm run typecheck` passed.
- Build gate: `npm run build` passed (Turbopack); `npm run check:bundle` all green (home back to 295KB after the dictionary split).
- Bundle regression found and fixed during this task: pre-split dictionary additions pushed home routes to 297KB (>295KB budget); the i18n-stats extraction both fixed the budget and delivers R12.22.

## 2026-09-07 — R12.3 Quiz score trend

Implemented R12.3 as a local-data-first quiz score trend with no fabricated historical dates:

- Added `src/lib/quiz-score-trend.ts` as a versioned pure aggregator over quiz definitions, current quiz progress, and the local attempt ledger.
- Added `tb-quiz-attempts` local ledger writes in `saveQuizProgress()` so completed positive-score quiz attempts record chapter, best, total, and timestamp.
- Kept current best scores authoritative in existing `tb-quiz-{chapter}` storage; the ledger is metadata only.
- Preserved legacy behavior: if no attempt ledger exists, trend output reports `dataSource: "current-quiz-progress-only"`, `hasLedger: false`, and warning `no-quiz-attempt-dates`.
- Tightened ledger writes so zero-score attempts are ignored and duplicate same-timestamp entries are not appended.
- Integrated an accessible quiz trend mini chart into `/[locale]/stats`, showing attempts in range, best score in range, current average score, completed quiz count, and a no-date notice for legacy data.
- Added zh/en stats labels for the quiz trend section.
- Added tests for trend bucketing, current best/average calculation, legacy no-date warnings, corrupt/unknown/invalid attempts, ledger normalization, zero-score/duplicate writes, and stats-page rendering.

Verification recorded:

- Targeted Vitest suite: `npx vitest run src/lib/quiz-score-trend.test.ts src/lib/quiz-attempt-ledger.test.ts src/components/stats-client.test.tsx` passed with 3 files and 12 tests.
- Full suite: `npm test` passed with 124 test files and 952 tests.
- Lint gate: `npm run lint -- --quiet` passed.
- Typecheck gate: `npm run typecheck` passed.

## 2026-09-07 — R12.2 Course completion trend

Implemented R12.2 as local-data-first course completion trend support without fabricating timestamps for legacy progress:

- Added `src/lib/course-completion-trend.ts` as a versioned pure aggregator over chapters, current progress, and the local completion ledger.
- Added `tb-progress-completions` ledger writes in `markRead()` so only first-time reads record completion timestamps; duplicate reads do not update history.
- Kept legacy progress non-inventive: when no ledger exists, trend output reports `dataSource: "current-progress-only"`, `hasLedger: false`, and warning `no-completion-dates`.
- Integrated a 7-day accessible mini bar chart into `StatsClient`, showing course completions, completed chapters, read docs, completion percentage, and a legacy-data notice when completion dates are unavailable.
- Added zh/en `stats` labels for the course completion trend section.
- Added tests for aggregator bucketing, chapter completion counting, duplicate/legacy/empty/corruption handling, progress ledger write behavior, and stats-page rendering.
